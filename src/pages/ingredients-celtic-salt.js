          Celtic salt, harvested from pristine coastal regions, is a cornerstone
          ingredient for creating organic sourdough bread. Unlike refined table
          salt, Celtic salt retains its trace minerals and natural moisture,
          offering a more robust flavor and superior nutritional profile.

        <h2>Benefits of Using Celtic Salt in Sourdough Bread</h2>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Flavor Enhancement</strong>
            <br />
            Celtic salt provides a depth of flavor that complements the tangy
            notes of sourdough. Its subtle mineral undertones create a richer
            and more complex taste.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Improved Dough Fermentation</strong>
            <br />
            The mineral content in Celtic salt supports the fermentation
            process, helping natural yeasts thrive. This results in better dough
            elasticity and a perfect crumb structure.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Healthier Nutritional Profile</strong>
            <br />
            Packed with over 80 trace minerals, Celtic salt enhances the
            nutritional value of your sourdough bread. It’s a healthier
            alternative to processed salts, aligning with the principles of
            organic baking.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Texture Optimization</strong>
            <br />
            The natural moisture in Celtic salt integrates seamlessly into the
            dough, ensuring even distribution and improving the final texture of
            the bread.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>How to Incorporate Celtic Salt into Sourdough Baking</h2>
        <p>Not all filtered water is the same. Here&amp;s what to look for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Measurement Matters:</strong> Use approximately 2% of the
            total flour weight to ensure a balanced flavor.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Dissolve for Uniformity:</strong> Dissolve the salt in water
            before mixing to avoid uneven distribution.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Timing is Key:</strong> Add the salt after the autolyse
            stage to avoid disrupting gluten development.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Why Organic Standards Matter</h2>
        <p>
          Using Celtic salt aligns with the organic philosophy of baking. Its
          unprocessed nature ensures your sourdough bread remains free from
          synthetic additives and chemicals, offering purity and authenticity in
          every bite.
        </p>
        <h2>Tips for Buying Quality Celtic Salt</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Look for certified organic sources.</li>
          <li>Choose coarse or fine grains based on your recipe’s needs.</li>
          <li>Avoid products with anti-caking agents to maintain purity.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          Celtic salt isn’t just a seasoning—it’s a transformative ingredient
          that elevates sourdough bread to an organic masterpiece. By choosing
          this mineral-rich salt, you’ll delight in better flavor, improved
          texture, and the satisfaction of crafting bread that’s as pure as it
          is delicious.
